# NLP Topic 1 Hallucination Detection 

## Milestone 2 
## Goal: Create two baseline models for our classification task

## Naive Bayes 
For the Naive Bayes baseline we created the file naive_bayes.py for an analysis on the overall performance. To see the results for the separate tasks see the file nb_function_with_outputs. 

## Vectara
For the Vectara model we created one file vectara_improved.py which computes the model for each task separately. 

## Model Evaluation
For the model evaluation we created a jupyter notebook named model_evaluation.ipynb, which computes all results also shown in the report. Also a more precise analysis on Naive Bayes is found in the file naive_bayes.ipynb  


## Requirements

Before running the codes for milestone 2, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, sklearn, nltk, imblearn, ast 

You can install them via pip:
pip install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, sklearn, nltk, imblearn, ast

## Usage

To run the code:

Make sure you have installed all the necessary dependencies listed above. 
Place the preprocessed data from Milestone 1 into the same directory as your script. Execute the scripts mentioned above to create the model and perform the model evaluation.
