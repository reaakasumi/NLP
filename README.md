a source the input passed to the models for generation --> 'src'   
a target the intended reference 'gold' text that the model ought to generate --> 'tgt'  
a hypothesis the actual model predicts --> 'hyp'  
a set of per annotator labels indicating whether each individual annotator thought this datapoint constituted a hallucination or not --> 'label'  
model name --> 'model'
