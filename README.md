# NLP Topic 1 Hallucination Detection 

## Milestone 2 
## Goal: Create two baseline models for our classification task

## Naive Bayes 
For the Naive Bayes baseline we created the file naive_bayes.py for an analysis on the overall performance. To see the results for the separate tasks see the file nb_function_with_outputs. 

## Vectara
For the Vectara model we created one file vectara_improved.py which computes the model for each task separately. 

## Model Evaluation
For the model evaluation we created a jupyter notebook named model_evaluation, which computes all results also shown in the report. 


## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, 

You can install them via pip:
pip install pandas numpy scipy torch scikit-learn nltk stanza contractions

## Usage

To run the code:

Make sure you have installed all the necessary dependencies listed above. 
Place the train.model-agnostic.json, val.model-agnostic.json, test.model-agnostic.json files in the same directory as your script.
Execute the script to perform the data analysis and preliminary preprocessing steps.
